# Frontend Mentor Challenges – Newbie to Junior Level
Welcome to my Frontend Mentor project collection! Over the past year and a half, I’ve built and improved my frontend development skills by completing challenges ranging from newbie to junior levels. This repository contains each project as I progressed, starting from my early days as a frontend developer to the current point in my journey.
## Repository Overview
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different challenge from (Frontend Mentor),[https://www.frontendmentor.io/home] and reflects my growth in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From basic layouts to more complex interactive components, each project showcases specific techniques and tools I’ve learned along the way.
## Projects
The following projects are organized by level and difficulty:

+ **Newbie Projects:** A series of initial projects that cover fundamental layout structures, responsive design basics, and entry-level JavaScript.
+ **Junior Projects:** More advanced challenges focusing on interactive elements, enhanced JavaScript functionality, and more complex responsive layouts.
